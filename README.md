Are you one of them who sets a New Year resolution (or) any goals at the beginning of the year but you don't follow it after?

Then this is the app for you.

## Idea behind goGoalz

People set goals to achieve things.  But, we tend to lose focus of most of the goals for some reason. So, I did a mini-survey with some close people to understand other's perspectives on why people lose focus after setting goals & how we can solve them.

### Problems

These are key problems identified from the survey:

1. Forgetting the goals due to busy life.
2. No Motivation to continue.
3. No way to Measure our goals.

### Solutions

These are the suggestion received from the survey to solve those problems:

1. Send a reminder mail every month to remember their goals.
2. Send Motivational quotes & images in reminder mail to continue their progress.
3. Offer statistics to show their growth.
4. Categorize the goals to know how much one is achieving or lagging in a specific category.
5. Shows Leader board to compete with others.

This made to create goGoalz.
